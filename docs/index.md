# About

A browser extension that displays the track, artist and album from the currently playing track on 90.3 KEXP. When the user clicks on the browser extension icon a window appears to display the album artwork (if available) song, artist and album. Now playing data is pulled from the [KEXP public facing API](https://api.kexp.org/v2/plays/).

KEXP is a listener-powered radio station out of Seattle Washington and streaming all over the world. Learn more about KEXP and it's mission at [KEXP.org](https://kexp.org/about/)
